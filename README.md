# advent-of-code 2024 🎄

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run a specific day, run:

```bash
bun start day-number
# e.g. bun start day-1
```

To create a new day, run:

```bash
bun new
```

This will create a new directory with the day number and populate it with the necessary files.

Happy advent of code!
